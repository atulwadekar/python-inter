## Intro
This folder holds the code for the backend of the Weather App. The backend will host the API endpoints that webpage calls to access the core data. Also the backend is where we will be working for most of the course - looking at improving the endpoints, authentication and even databases! 

## Running the code!
0. Download pip3 and install flask by running the following command 'pip3 install flask'
0. From a command line terminal in the root folder, run the command 'python3 main.py'. This will start the server and host it on 'localhost:5000'
